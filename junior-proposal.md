**Project Name:** Mal0


**Is your project New or Old?** New


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description 

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why** This is a project I have wanted to try and create since I got into coding. An app that takes live google images of near your location and puts a creature in them. Based on scp-1471. I hope to get the back-end and api set up.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project** I have not taken a mobile course yet, so I willhave to wait to create the app version. And I have very little API work, however, I will use this to learn more on using them.

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.** The back-end of putting an image on top of an image

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**  use a google view api

## Car
**ONE additional feature** combine the two and put the image on top of the google api

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1

1. Goal 1 Finish a solo project to a standard above normal
1. Goal 2 Learn how to use an API
1. Goal 3 Don't lose focus and fail again
